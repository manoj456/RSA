

This is how I did it:


I have input files to my program finalrsa.c:
plain.txt
plain2.txt
genplain.txt

I created DER format private key named as openss_priv1024.der in openssl(1024bit key)

I parsed this openssl privatekey and retrieved the n,e,d values and encrypted and decrypted plain2.txt using my functions i wrote

I also generated keys and saved those in DER formats in:
private.der
public.der

Later,a prompt is asked if you want to encrypt and decrypt data file plain.txt using my program generated keys 
and encrypted saved in cipher.txt

Later,using commands to decrypt in openssl i used my private key and get back the data file encrypted using my private key in the program
Now,cross compatibility checked.

Now,take any genplain.txt and using my private.der and public.der performed encryption and decryption operations and verified.

Cautious:remove cipher.txt before re compiling the program
